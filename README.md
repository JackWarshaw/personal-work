# personal-work

Hi! If you're reading this you're most likely checking this page to see my previous project experience and some examples of code I've written in the past. Bellow, you'll find some short descriptions that detail what's contained in this github and what their purposes are.

Cosmic Scale (can be found at https://chloemb.github.io/352project/)

This was a game created by myself and a few students, which we created primarily for those who have motor disadvantages that dont allow them to easily use standard controllers. Instead this game is controlled using a player's vocal pitch in real time, which lets a user play the game regardless of any motor disadvantages.

Music Player

This was an assignment for one of my design classes in which we were given a few prebuilt assets and had to design a music player with it. 
The assignment was a test of proficiency for html, css, and java and additionally was supposed to make sure we knew basic design principles.

Personal Website

Currently in progress! This site will eventually be hosted on a Raspberry Pi but lives here for now until completion.
