# personal-work

Hi! If you're reading this you're most likely checking this page to see my previous project experience and some examples of code I've written in the past. Bellow, you'll find some short descriptions that detail what's contained in this github and what their purposes are.

Music Player

This was an assignment for one of my design classes in which we were given a few prebuilt assets and had to design a music player with it. 
The assignment was a test of proficiency for html, css, and java and additionally was supposed to make sure we knew basic design principles.

Currently Untitled Personal Project

In my spare time I've been working on a networking/lifestyle app that allows you to make friends with strangers in your vicinity by linking people with common interests. After a user inputs several interests about themselves (ranging from bands they like to restaurants or other places they like to frequent), the app collects the same data from other users in a predetermined vicinity and finds people with compatable interests for you to talk to. Currrently the project does not have a name, and it is in the very early stages of developement so the code is not yet on this github, but should be posted shortly when a working prototype is complete.
